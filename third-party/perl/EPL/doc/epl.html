<h1>Preface</h1>

<p>Like a lot of people, I learned Perl because of the Web.  I came to
GNU from a Microsoft background early in 1996, when Microsoft had only
begun to realize that the Internet was hot.  I was deeply infused with
Web hype, willing to try something different, and aware that the Web
ran on Unix and Perl.

<p>I came to Emacs because of genetic predisposition.  A tightly
integrated, yet versatile, complex system with endless opportunities
for learning and automation helps reduce my cholesterol and, I think,
aids respiration and digestion.  It had all the good features of
Microsoft Office, without all the headaches and nausea.

<p>Well, it had <em>almost</em> all the good features.

<p>Emacs is an oasis of integration in the chaotic and disparate realm of
Linux and Unix.  (I later learned that the Unix kernel is a thing of
some elegance, but at the level of <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>,
<small>X11R6</small>, and <code>~/.fvwmrc</code>, there was little cohesion.)  As
I entered this realm, it irked me that I had to learn <em>two</em>
scripting languages to do what I wanted, whereas Visual Basic, clunky
as it is, does everything on Windows.

<p>Speaking of that other--umm--language, Visual Basic shares an
important feature with Perl: It is for ordinary people.

<p>Now, I am very glad that Emacs lets you do just about anything with
Elisp (such as write EPL).  But my conceptual mapping from Windows
onto Unix paired Visual Basic with Perl, not Lisp, as the general
workhorse get-it-done tool.  It seemed to me not right that the
standard, full-featured editor on my new system could not understand
the standard, full-featured scripting language.  With EPL--Emacs
PerL, or Emacs-Perl-Lisp--I hope to rectify the situation.

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>EPL is an extension for <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">GNU Emacs</a> and <a href="http://www.xemacs.org">XEmacs</a> that lets you write
commands in Perl.  It is also a programming interface for Elisp
(see <a href="#Emacs%20Lisp">Emacs Lisp</a>) programs to use Perl features and an interface
for Perl to use Emacs.

<p>This document assumes knowledge of Emacs terms such as "the
minibuffer" and "<kbd>M-x</kbd>" (see <a href="emacs.html#Running%20Commands%20by%20Name">Top</a>).  It assumes knowledge of Perl
references and nested data structures
(<a href="http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/CPAN/perl/pod/perlref.html">perlref(1)</a>), and packages and modules
(<a href="http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/CPAN/perl/pod/perlmod.html">perlmod(1)</a>).

<h2>Perl Example</h2>

<p>Let's illustrate EPL with an example.  Suppose you often want to edit
many files in the same directory based on some text that they contain. 
You want a command that will look for a specified regular expression
in each file, and if found, open the file in a buffer.  You prefer
Perl regular expressions to Emacs ones, and you are not interested in
files that Perl considers to be binary.

<p>Here is some Emacs Perl code that will do it:

<pre>use IO::Dir;
use IO::File;

sub find_my_files ($$) {
    my ($dirname, $regex) = @_;

    # Convert "~" to home dir.
    $dirname = &amp;expand_file_name ($dirname);

    my $dh = IO::Dir-&gt;new ($dirname)
        or die "$dirname: $!";

    my $count = 0;
    while (defined ($filename = $dh-&gt;read)) {
        $filename = "$dirname/$filename";

        # Skip directories and binary files.
        next unless -f($filename) &amp;&amp; -T($filename);

        my $fh = IO::File-&gt;new ($filename);
        if (!$fh) {
            warn ("$filename: $!");
            next;
        }
        while (defined ($_ = &lt;$fh&gt;)) {
            if (/$regex/) {
                &amp;find_file($filename);
                $count++;
                last;
            }
        }
    }
    &amp;message ("Found $regex in $count file(s)");
}

defun (\*find_files_containing_regex,
       "Open all files whose contents match a Perl regular expression.",
       interactive("DLook in directory: \nsPerl regex: "),
       \&amp;find_my_files);
</pre>

<p>You would save this in a file, load it with <kbd>M-x perl-load-file</kbd>
(see <a href="#Evaluation">Evaluation</a>) or from <code>~/.emacs</code>, and use it as <kbd>M-x
find-files-containing-regex</kbd>.

<p>The command prompts for a directory name (with &lt;TAB&gt;-completion
and history) and an arbitrary string (regex).  It signals an error if
it can't read the directory, and otherwise summarizes the results in
the minibuffer.  You can access its documentation just like that of
any Emacs command, using <kbd>C-h f find-files-containing-regex</kbd>.

<h2>History</h2>

<p>EPL works by starting a subprocess the first time a Perl interpreter
is needed to carry out some function.  Emacs and Perl use interprocess
communication (IPC) to invoke functions and send each other data until
the parent process terminates.  Variations on this theme may involve
Perl as the parent process or more than one child per parent.

<p>This is not the only possible implementation.  In principle, the same
functionality could be achieved by translating Perl to Lisp.  That has
been a goal of the GNU project since 1994, except that RMS wants to
replace Elisp with Scheme first.  For details, see <a href="elisp.html#Lisp%20History">Lisp History</a>, and
<a href="http://www.vanderburg.org/Tcl/war/">http://www.vanderburg.org/Tcl/war/</a>.

<p>Another possibility, which has been realized by a program called
<a href="http://john-edwin-tobey.org/perlmacs/">Perlmacs</a>, is to embed
the Perl interpreter in Emacs and let it operate directly at the C
level the way the Elisp interpreter does.  This probably results in
faster execution, but it ties an executable to specific versions of
Perl and Emacs.  Perlmacs does not support XEmacs.

<h2>Emacs Lisp</h2>

<p>Whether you write EPL programs or Elisp programs, you are writing
Emacs programs.  The GNU and XEmacs projects maintain comprehensive
and thorough documentation of the functions available to Emacs
extensions.

<p>Of course, those documents assume that extensions use Lisp.  Still,
they are an invaluable resource, and any programmer with a general
understanding of functions and variables can make good use of them. 
This manual makes frequent reference to the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/elisp/">GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</a>. 
If you don't have it, go get it!  It should be available wherever you
got Emacs or from the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/doc/doc.html">Free Software Foundation</a>.

<p>Who knows?  You may fall in love with Lisp.

<h1>Features</h1>

<p>This chapter describes EPL's mapping between Perl's language features
and Emacs Lisp's.  Perl and Lisp are quite different, so some features
favored by one language are imperfectly or awkwardly reproduced in the
other.  EPL follows Perl's philosophy of making simple things easy and
hard things possible.

<br>

<h2>Data Conversion</h2>

<p>EPL provides essentially two mechanisms to transfer data between
languages--as function arguments and return values.  In both cases,
data may be passed either by value or by reference.  The default is by
value, since references incur overhead (see <a href="#References%20Incur%20Overhead">References Incur Overhead</a>).

<p>In EPL, <dfn>by value</dfn> means recursively (or "deeply") copied.  That
is, containers in the originating language are converted to analogous
containers in the destination language, and any contained elements not
explicitly marked as pass-by-reference are likewise converted.  This
allows the recipient to examine a structure using its built-in
accessors, but changes will not apply to the original.  Also, language
peculiarities result in information loss during some conversions, so
pass-by-value is not completely reversible (see <a href="#Conversion%20Is%20Imperfect">Conversion Is Imperfect</a>).

<p>This section describes the conversions that apply to each language's
scalar and container types.  For a complete description of Lisp types,

<h3>Scalars</h3>

<p>Lisp integers, floats, and strings all become Perl scalars.  A simple
Perl scalar becomes either an integer, a float, or a string.

<p>Unfortunately, it is hard to be certain which type will be chosen.  It
depends on the value.  Perl 5.005 and later can distinguish among the
literal constants <code>1</code>, <code>"1"</code>, and <code>1.0</code>, and EPL uses
this information.  However, not all Perl integers fit into an Emacs
integer (which is 28 bits, see <a href="elisp.html#Integer%20Type">Integer Type</a>).  Integers that would overflow are upgraded to
floats when converted.

<p>You <em>may</em> be able to specify string conversion by wrapping a
variable in double quotes (<code>"$var"</code>), float by adding zero
(<code>$var + 0</code>), and integer using (<code>int($var)</code>).  Perhaps a
future version of EPL will provide an explicit means of specification.

<p>Interesting character encodings such as UTF-8 are not currently
supported.  All strings are considered unibyte.  See <a href="elisp.html#Text%20Representations">Text Representations</a>.

<br>

<h3>The Null Value</h3>

<p>As an exception to the rule for symbols (see <a href="#Symbols%20and%20Globrefs">Symbols and Globrefs</a>), <code>nil</code> in Lisp corresponds to <code>undef</code> in Perl.

<p>In Lisp, <code>nil</code> is really a symbol.  However, it is typically used
as the boolean value <var>false</var>.  Perl symbols (glob references)
evaluate to <var>true</var> in boolean context.  It is very natural to
convert <code>nil</code> to <code>undef</code>.

Up:<a rel=up href="#Data%20Conversion">Data Conversion</a>
<br>

<h3>Symbols and Globrefs</h3>

<p>Glob references become symbols in Lisp.  Underscores are swapped with
hyphens in the name, since Perl prefers underscores and Lisp prefers
hyphens.

Up:<a rel=up href="#Data%20Conversion">Data Conversion</a>
<br>

<h3>Lists and Arrayrefs</h3>

<p>Lists are a central data structure in Lisp.  To make it as easy as
possible to pass lists to Lisp functions that require them, Perl array
references are converted Lisp lists.  For example, the Perl expression

<pre>["x", ["y", 1]]
</pre>
is converted to
<pre>'("x" ("y" 1))
</pre>

<p>in Lisp.  Note, however, that the empty list in Lisp is
indistinguishable from <code>nil</code>, so it becomes the undefined value,
not an arrayref.  See <a href="#The%20Null%20Value">The Null Value</a>.

Previous:<a rel=previous href="#Lists%20and%20Arrayrefs">Lists and Arrayrefs</a>,
Up:<a rel=up href="#Data%20Conversion">Data Conversion</a>
<br>

<h3>Vectors</h3>

<p>Adding <code>\</code> to an arrayref makes it an arrayref ref, which EPL
treats as a vector in Lisp.  For example, Perl <code>\[1, 2, []]</code>
becomes Lisp <code>[1 2 nil]</code>.

<br>

<h3>Conses</h3>

<p>Conses that are not lists become Emacs::Lisp::Cons objects.

<p><strong>Compatibility note:</strong>  In Perlmacs, such conses become opaque
objects (see <a href="#Pass-by-Reference">Pass-by-Reference</a>).

<pre>$x = &amp;cons("left", "right");
print ref($x);                # "Emacs::Lisp::Cons"
print $x-&gt;car;                # "left"
print $x-&gt;cdr;                # "right"
</pre>
But:
<pre>$x = &amp;cons ("top", undef);    # a Lisp list
print ref($x);                # "ARRAY"
print $x-&gt;[0];                # "top"

<h3>Pass-by-Reference</h3>

<p>XXX Rewrite.

<p>A <dfn>shallow copy</dfn> simply wraps a Perl scalar in a Lisp object or
vice versa.  Wrapped Perl values appear as a Lisp objects of type
<code>perl-value</code>.  Wrapped Lisp values appear in Perl as objects of
class <code>Emacs::Lisp::Object</code>.  See <a href="#References%20Incur%20Overhead">References Incur Overhead</a>,
for issues relating to wrapped data.

<p>In Perl, the <code>wrap</code> function wraps its argument in a Lisp object. 
This allows Perl data such as arrays to be passed by reference to Lisp
functions.  Another way Lisp can obtain references to Perl data is by
using <code>perl-eval-raw</code> or <code>perl-call-raw</code>.  Lisp can tell
whether an object refers to Perl data by using the <code>perl-value-p</code>
function.

<p>Of course, <code>wrap</code> is a Perl function, so the value it returns is
really its argument wrapped in a Lisp object wrapped in a Perl object. 
But when you pass this object to Lisp as an argument or function
return value, Lisp gets a reference to the original object, and no
automatic conversion occurs.  Lisp may explicitly convert it at any
time using the <code>perl-to-lisp</code> function, and any changes made by
Perl will be visible at the time of conversion.

<p>The Lisp function <code>perl-wrap</code> is the counterpart of Perl's
<code>wrap</code> function, and the <code>Emacs::Lisp::Object</code> package
provides the equivalent of <code>perl-call-raw</code>.  The functions of
package <code>Emacs::Lisp</code> return deep copies of Lisp function return
values (see see <a href="#Functions">Functions</a>).  However, the corresponding
<code>Emacs::Lisp::Object</code> functions return references to live Lisp
objects.

<p>Since a wrapped Lisp object appears in Perl as an
<code>Emacs::Lisp::Object</code> blessed reference, if follows that it can
be used with method syntax to invoke a function and pass itself as the
first argument.  Thus, supposing <code>v</code> is a vector of conses and
<code>$v</code> is its wrapper, this Perl code

<pre>$v-&gt;aref(3)-&gt;setcdr(t);
</pre>
has the effect of the following Lisp:
<pre>(setcdr (aref v 3) t)
</pre>

<p>An Emacs::Lisp::Object's <code>to_perl</code> method performs a deep copy
and is the counterpart of <code>perl-to-lisp</code>.

<p>Lisp functions called through package Emacs::Lisp convert their return
values using deep copying.  The same functions are accessible through
Emacs::Lisp::Object, which does shallow conversion and always returns
an Emacs::Lisp::Object object.

<p>These examples show how the data wrapping functions work in Perl:

<pre>$x = wrap [1, 2, 3];
print ref($x);           # "Emacs::Lisp::Object"
print ref($x-&gt;to_perl);  # "ARRAY"
print @{&amp;list(2, 3)};    # "23"

$x = Emacs::Lisp::Object::list(2, 3);
print ref($x);           # "Emacs::Lisp::Object"
print @{$x-&gt;to_perl};    # "23"
</pre>

<p>And in Lisp:

<pre>XXX
</pre>

<h1>Internals</h1>

<p>This chapter introduces the concepts involved in supporting
single-threaded distributed exception handling and garbage collection
for languages like Perl and Emacs Lisp.  These languages have a lot
more in common underneath than meets the eye.

<p>The chapter ends with a more concrete description of EPL's protocol.

<h2>GNU Free Documentation License</h2>

<p align="center">Version 1.1, March 2000</p>

<pre>Copyright &copy; 2000 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>

<ol type=1 start=0>
<li>PREAMBLE

<p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
written document <dfn>free</dfn> in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modifications made by others.

<p>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

<p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

</p><li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

<p>This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any
such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
addressed as "you".

<p>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

<p>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

<p>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.

<p>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.

<p>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
<small>ASCII</small> without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
<small>SGML</small> or <small>XML</small> using a publicly available
<small>DTD</small>, and standard-conforming simple <small>HTML</small> designed
for human modification.  Opaque formats include PostScript,
<small>PDF</small>, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, <small>SGML</small> or <small>XML</small> for which
the <small>DTD</small> and/or processing tools are not generally available,
and the machine-generated <small>HTML</small> produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

<p>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

</p><li>VERBATIM COPYING

<p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

</p><li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

<p>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.

<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

</p><li>MODIFICATIONS

<p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

<ol type=A start=1>
</p><li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

<li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).

<li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

<li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

<li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

<li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

<li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

<li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

<li>Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

<li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

<li>In any section entitled "Acknowledgments" or "Dedications",
preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgments
and/or dedications given therein.

<li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

<li>Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

<li>Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"
or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
</ol>

<p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

<p>You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

</p><li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

<p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice.

<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgments",
and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
entitled "Endorsements."

</p><li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

<p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

<p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

</p><li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

<p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

<p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate. 
Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.

</p><li>TRANSLATION

<p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License provided that you also include the
original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
between the translation and the original English version of this
License, the original English version will prevail.

</p><li>TERMINATION

<p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

</p><li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

<p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.

<h3>ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

<pre>  Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
  or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
  with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with the
  Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>.
  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
  Free Documentation License''.
</pre>

<p>If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
"Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

<p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
